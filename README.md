TalentGraph Data
================

## Purpose ##
This repo is my attempt to model data related to requisitions, skills, candidates, talents, and locations in a graph database.  Specifically in Neo4J.

I intend to write scripts loading some data (perhaps fictional, perhaps pulled from FO) and building out the relationships between requisitions and skills; and between candidates and talents.  Hopefully we can work location (requisition and candidate) in as well.  Also, try to get some "goodness of fit" type queries running.

## How to use ##
coming soon
