// They are by no means complete and they have a lot of things I consider to be duplicates.

// However, since we are dealing with millions of people using natural language to describe things, I don't think 
// a perfectly curated, hierarchical, logical taxonomy of skills exists.  And if it DID exist, 80% of the people using 
// it would think it was incomplete, organized incorrectly, or would just plain hate it!
